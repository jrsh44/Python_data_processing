ON Users.Id = Questions.OwnerUserId
ORDER BY TotalViews DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Task 4

        WHERE AnswersNumber > QuestionsNumber
        ORDER BY AnswersNumber DESC
        LIMIT 5
    ) AS PostsCounts
JOIN Users
ON PostsCounts.OwnerUserId = Users.Id
```
Task 5
```sql
SELECT Title, CommentCount, ViewCount, CommentsTotalScore, DisplayName, Reputation, Location
